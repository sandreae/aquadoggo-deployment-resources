# `aquadoggo` deployment resources

An incomplete collection of "playbooks" documenting the required steps for deploying an
[`aquadoggo`](https://github.com/p2panda/aquadoggo) node on common deployment platforms (or none at all).

Note that all the deployments will only include basic configuration of the `aquadoggo` node. You
will need to adjust the configuration to suit your needs, please see the relevant
[`aquadoggo` cli documentation](https://github.com/p2panda/aquadoggo/tree/main/aquadoggo_cli) for detailed instructions.

PRs for not-yet-documented platforms welcome :-]
